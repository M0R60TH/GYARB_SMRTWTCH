# High School Project - SmartWatch
Code used by two pupils at Pauliskolan in their high school final projekt and report.
This project is the creation of a smartwatch from commonly avaliable parts and code.
Used mainly are the M5Stack Core 2 and it's accompanying IDE M5Stack UIFlow.
## .m5f vs .py
The IDE that we work in uses a proprietary file system called .m5f 
These are in essence just .py files as M5Stack uses micropython for development.
They do, however, contain some extra information used for creating the block environment in UIFlow.
We have therefore chosen to upload both a .m5f and a .py version for each file.
